## Introduction
The Flexostat's main components have gone through several iterations, 
some of which break compatibility.  There are two primary reasons for 
new versions.  The first is improvements in accuracy, ease of assembly
or reliability.  The second reason is to work around components that
are no longer available.  

Below you will find a list of compatible components and in some cases
a compatability matrix.
