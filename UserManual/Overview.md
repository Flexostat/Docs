#Operating Overview

Setting up the turbidostat generally takes two days sepparated by an autoclave step.  This can all be done in one day if you wait for the autoclave.  

##Day -1:

  1.  Prepare media using your preferred method.
    *  If autoclaving media with the rest of the turbidostat components clamp off the media line to prevent media from flowing into the culture tubes.
    *  Keep in mind, continuous culture devices consume one volume per chamber per generation, so yeast doubling every 90 minutes in 15ml volumes over eight chambers takes 15 ml * 8  / 1.5 hr = 80 ml/hr or about 2 L per day.  
  2.  [Assemble and autoclave the closed system][1]
