#Operating Overview

Setting up the turbidostat generally takes two days separated by an autoclave step.  This can all be done in one day if you wait for the autoclave.  

##Day -1:

1.  Prepare media using your preferred method.
  *  If autoclaving media with the rest of the turbidostat components clamp
    off the media line to prevent media from flowing into the culture tubes.
  *  Keep in mind, continuous culture devices consume one volume per chamber
    per generation, so yeast doubling every 90 minutes in 15ml volumes over
    eight chambers takes 15 ml * 8  / 1.5 h = 80 ml/h or about 2 L per day.
2.  [Assemble and autoclave the closed system][1]

## Day 0:

1. Attach non-autoclavable parts
  * Attach sterile syringe
  * Attach media line to media bottle
2. Attach closed system to machinery
  * Attach syringe to syringe pump
  * Place culture vessels into their chambers
  * Attach media tubing to pinch valves
  * Connect air tubing to pressure regulators
  * Connect effluent tubing to waste bottles
3. unclip/open media bottle tube
4. Prime pump
  * Prime siphon
  * Fill chambers with media
5. [Start software and blank][2]
6. Inoculate
